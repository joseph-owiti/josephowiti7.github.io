            <h1>Puzzle Me This:<br />Playing Video Games is Good for your Brain</h1>
        
            <p>Whether playing video games has negative effects is something that has been debated for 30 years, in much the same way that rock and roll, television, and even the novel faced much the same criticisms in their time.<br /><br />

Purported negative effects such as addiction, increased aggression, and various health consequences such as obesity and repetitive strain injuries tend to get far more media coverage than the positives. I know from my own research examining both sides that my papers on video game addiction receive far more publicity than my research into the social benefits of, for example, playing online role-playing games. <br /><br />

However there is now a wealth of research which shows that video games can be put to educational and therapeutic uses, as well as many studies which reveal how playing video games can improve reaction times and hand-eye co-ordination. For example, research has shown that spatial visualisation ability, such as mentally rotating and manipulating two- and three-dimensional objects, improves with video game playing. <br /><br />

To add to this long line of studies demonstrating the more positive effects of video games is a study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences by Vikranth Bejjanki and colleagues. Their newly published paper demonstrates that the playing of action video games – the sort of fast-paced, 3D shoot-em-up beloved of doomsayers in the media – confirms what other studies have revealed, that players show improved performance in perception, attention, and cognition. <br /><br />

In a series of experiments on small numbers of gamers (10 to 14 people in each study), the researchers reported that gamers with previous experience of playing such action video games were better at perceptual tasks such as pattern discrimination than gamers with less experience. <br /><br />

In another experiment, they trained gamers that had little previous experience of playing action games, giving them 50 hours practice. It was showed that these gamers performed much better on perceptual tasks than they had prior to their training. The paper concludes: <br /><br />

The enhanced learning of the regularity and structure of environments may act as a core mechanism by which action video game play influences performance in perception, attention, and cognition. <br /> <br />

In my own papers, I have pointed out many features and qualities that make video games potentially useful. For instance, in an educational context, video games can be fun and stimulating, which means it’s easier to maintain a pupil’s undivided attention for longer. Because of the excitement, video games may also be a more appealing way of learning than traditional methods for some. <br /><br />

Video games have an appeal that crosses many demographic boundaries, such as age, gender, ethnicity, or educational attainment. They can be used to help set goals and rehearse working towards them, provide feedback, reinforcement, self-esteem, and maintain a record of behavioural change. <br /><br />

Their interactivity can stimulate learning, allowing individuals to experience novelty, curiosity and challenge that stimulates learning. There is the opportunity to develop transferable skills, or practice challenging or extraordinary activities, such as flight simulators, or simulated operations.<br /><br />

Because video games can be so engaging, they can also be used therapeutically. For instance, they can be used as a form of physiotherapy as well as in more innovative contexts. A number of studies have shown that when children play video games following chemotherapy they need fewer painkillers than others. <br /><br />

Video games have great educational potential in addition to their entertainment value. Games specifically designed to address a specific problem or teach a specific skill have been very successful, precisely because they are motivating, engaging, interactive, and provide rewards and reinforcement to improve. <br /><br />

But the transferability of skills outside the game-playing context is an important factor. What’s also clear from the scientific literature is that the negative consequences of playing almost always involve people that are excessive video game players. There is little evidence of serious acute adverse effects on health from moderate play. <br /><br />

            <h1>Video Game Sports Changed My Life</h1>
        
            <p>Decay of Logos, at its heart, is a plucky, independently developed third person action-adventure aspiring to fill the behemoth sized shoes left by massive hits like Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild and Dark Souls. It’s easy to see those inspirations in the game, utilizing the enemy respawns at checkpoints similar to Dark Souls and the vibrant colors and dungeon puzzle solving similar to the iconic Zelda series. Undoubtedly, Decay of Logos on the Nintendo Switch has a vision and goal in mind, but unfortunately it falls well short of the mark in terms of execution. <br /><br />
                
            Decay of Logos is packed full of ambitious and interesting mechanics, but it’s certainly a shame that nearly all of them feel so poorly implemented and broken that it makes the game a slog. The most egregious example of which is undoubtedly the mystical elk companion that the developers themselves say is intended to be the core of the gameplay. The elk companion is used as inventory management, a solution for puzzles, help for traversal as a mount, and occasionally a partner in combat. The only issue is that, at least in the Switch version of the game, the elk companion is frustrating and unreliable to a point of hindrance. 

            In my time with the game, the elk was missing a majority of times, rarely came when called upon, frustrating to use as a mount, and a test of patience to get in position for a puzzle solution. The inventory management aspect of the elk was difficult to use, as when my character found something new the elk was nowhere around and I would have to make a decision about which gear to leave behind. It was simpler to leave the elk alone due to the frustration that ensued in trying to make it useful, but the issue would always rear it’s antlered ugly head when Decay of Logos required the use of the frustrating elk.<br/><br/>
                
            Elk related issues aside, there are problems abound in the gameplay mechanics of Decay of Logos. The player character has an internal meter of exhaustion and if you do not sleep at the designated save points often enough her stats will diminish and ultimately lead to her hits being half as strong and her defense lowered. The exhaustion mechanic wouldn’t be too much of an issue, but it seemed like your character never stayed well rested for very long and the rest locations were spaced fairly far apart.

            Functionally, the mechanic felt like a permanent stat de-buff that ranged in intensity. For example, I rested at a save point then ran across the area to a puzzle location only to find out I didn’t have the required items, but in checking my inventory I noticed my stats were already de-buffed due to exhaustion. This seemed to greatly hinder my willingness to explore, which is one of the pillars of the game’s design. <br /><br />
                
            
            Decay of Logos prides itself on a hands free exploration that tosses the player into the world and tasks them with figuring out things for themselves. Whether or not this is a positive is a matter of taste and experience with the genre, as there are games that can pull off a hands free model exceptionally well. However, Decay of Logos would greatly benefit from some more player guidance due to some confusing map designs that will often have the player running in circles, without so much as a map, looking for items to complete puzzles. 

            These are deep mechanically intrinsic issues I have found in the game and it only gets worse from there. The Nintendo Switch port of Decay of Logos is severely broken in ways I’ve yet to see on the system before. I could rattle off my laundry list of bugs and glitches all day; I took a hit from an enemy and the game lost sound, I paused the game a few minutes while my Switch was docked and the game ran at an abysmal and laggy framerate until I undocked and re-docked, I tried to use a healing item and I lost all ability to move my character, I fell off a platform and was stuck in the falling animation inches from the ground. The list goes on and on and is frankly unacceptable for a game claiming to be out of beta or early access. <br /><br />
                
            The most heartbreaking part of all of these issues is that when you play Decay of Logos, it’s clear to see the intentions and the artistic flair the developers bring to the table. The game has a striking crisp style paired with a moody atmosphere and thought out world that’s built by exploration and interaction. However all of the faults quickly pile up and make the game a true test of patience that unfortunately make it nearly impossible to recommend to anyone, especially the Switch owners who have an added amount of bugs and issues to contend with. Only the most masochistic gamers with an overabundance of time on their hands should willingly attempt to tackle this beast. <br /><br />

            <h1>Adventure Awaits<br/>If You're Willing To Go For It</h1>
            
            <p>Playing video games, including violent shooter games, may boost children's learning, health and social skills, according to a review of research in American Psychologist.<br /><br/>

            The study comes out as debate continues among psychologists and other health professionals regarding the effects of violent media on youth. An APA task force is conducting a comprehensive review of research on violence in video games and interactive media and will release its findings later this year.<br /><br/>

            "Important research has already been conducted for decades on the negative effects of gaming, including addiction, depression and aggression, and we are certainly not suggesting that this should be ignored," says Isabela Granic, PhD, of Radboud University Nijmegen in The Netherlands, lead author of the article. "However, to understand the impact of video games on children's and adolescents' development, a more balanced perspective is needed."<br /><br/>

            While one widely held view maintains that playing video games is intellectually lazy, such play actually may strengthen a range of cognitive skills such as spatial navigation, reasoning, memory and perception, according to several studies reviewed in the article. This is particularly true for shooter video games, which are often violent, the authors found. A 2013 meta-analysis found that playing shooter video games improved a player's capacity to think about objects in three dimensions just as well as academic courses designed to enhance these same skills, according to the study.<br /><br/>

            "This has critical implications for education and career development, as previous research has established the power of spatial skills for achievement in science, technology, engineering and mathematics," Granic says.<br /><br/>

            This enhanced thinking was not found when playing other types of video games, such as puzzles or role-playing games.<br /><br/>

            Playing video games may also help children develop problem-solving skills, the authors said. The more adolescents reported playing strategic video games, such as role-playing games, the more they improved in problem solving and school grades the following year, according to a long-term study published in 2013. Children's creativity was also enhanced by playing any kind of video game, including violent games, but not when the children used other forms of technology, such as a computer or cell phone, other research revealed.<br /><br/>

            Simple games that are easy to access and can be played quickly, such as "Angry Birds," can improve players' moods, promote relaxation and ward off anxiety, the study said. "If playing video games simply makes people happier, this seems to be a fundamental emotional benefit to consider," said Granic. The authors also highlighted the possibility that video games are effective tools for learning resilience in the face of failure. By learning to cope with ongoing failures in games, the authors suggest that children build emotional resilience they can rely upon in their everyday lives.<br /><br/>

            Another stereotype the research challenges is the socially isolated gamer. More than 70 percent of gamers play with a friend, and millions of people worldwide participate in massive virtual worlds through video games such as "Farmville" and "World of Warcraft," the article noted. Multiplayer games become virtual social communities, where decisions need to be made quickly about whom to trust or reject and how to lead a group, the authors said. People who play video games, even if they are violent, that encourage cooperation are more likely to be helpful to others while gaming than those who play the same games competitively, a 2011 study found.<br /><br/></p>
